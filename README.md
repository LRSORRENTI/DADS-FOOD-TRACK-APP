# DADS-FOOD-TRACK-APP

## Going to build a CRUD app for my Dad, I know he's really trying become healthier, and maybe this will help, I'm currently learning the MERN stack, I think I'll build this app for my Dad in tandem with the MERN course, that way it'll help both my Dad and myself, I need to learn MERN, and a LOT of other stuff but I think this will be good for me

##

## I'm going to make this app for my Dad, I just talked to him about maybe using an app to help him improve his diet, this will be an important project to finish and see all the way through

## Come on Luke, don't leave this one unfinished

### Even if I can just do a quick pseudo-code inside here

### In no particular order, I'll re-order these steps later

### Set up a login / profile screen for him

### Add a food logging component

### Calorie calcultor somewhere

### CRUD functionality

### Meal planner component

### Recipe recommendations, perhaps try to find an API similar to that joke api you found, but for recipes instead
